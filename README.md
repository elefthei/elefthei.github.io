About me
==========

I am 4th year PhD student in the University of Pennsylvania advised by [Sebastian Angel](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sga001/)
and [Steve Zdancewic](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/). I am interested in the reliability, security and privacy of computer systems through
program verification (Coq, Z3, F\*) and cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs) and I consider the two approaches complementary.
Before starting my PhD I worked for 5 years in industry as a Software Engineer ([Bridgewater Associates](https://www.bridgewater.com/), [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and Tech Lead at [UnifyID](https://www.rsaconference.com/library/press-release/unifyid-unanimously-named-rsa-conference-2017s-most). I completed by Bachelor's and Masters in MIT my thesis advisors were [Frans Kaashoek](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaashoek/) and [Nicolai Zeldovich](http://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/).
I am originally from Thessaloniki, Greece and I like hiking and camping.
